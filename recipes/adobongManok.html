  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Adobo is a quintessential Filipino dish featuring meat (commonly chicken or pork) braised in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns. The cooking process involves simmering the ingredients until the meat is tender and the flavors meld together, resulting in a savory and tangy stew often served with steamed rice. Due to its vinegar content, adobo has a long shelf life and was traditionally packed for travelers.
