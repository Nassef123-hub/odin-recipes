  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Beef Rendang is a magnificent, slow-cooked Indonesian and Malaysian dish celebrated for its complex depth of flavor and tender texture. It is a dry curry characterized by an aromatic paste known as rempah, which typically includes ingredients such as chilies, shallots, garlic, ginger, turmeric, galangal, and lemongrass. These spices are saut√©ed and then simmered with cubes of beef (traditionally tough cuts like shank or chuck) in rich coconut milk and toasted coconut flakes, or kerisik.</p>
