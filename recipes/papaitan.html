  <h1>Papaitan</h1>
  <img src="papaitan.jpg">
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Papaitan is a traditional Ilocano stew from the Philippines, made from goat or beef innards like tripe, liver, and intestines, which gives it a rich and hearty flavor. The name, derived from the Ilocano word "pait" (bitter), comes from the use of bile, which provides a signature bitter taste, often balanced with souring agents like tamarind and spicy chilies.  
  This rustic and flavorful dish is commonly served as a "pulutan" or appetizer alongside rice, and is a testament to the resourcefulness of Ilocano cuisine, using ingredients traditionally available in the region. While bile is the traditional source of its distinctive bitterness, a souring agent is typically added to the dish to balance the flavors, and some modern variations may substitute bitter gourd for bile or use only beef innards.
